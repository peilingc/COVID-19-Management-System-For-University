# COVID-19-Management-System-For-University
This project aims to help universities to manage Covid-19 at campus from testing to vaccination, from quarantine to hospitalization. The flow is based on the current covid-19 testing flow at Northeastern University. We extends the flow to so that the university not only can track testing results, they can send positive students to quanrantine, and further send severe students to hospitals. 

This GUI application is a NetBeans project. The database we use is DB4O.
For more details about this application, please refer to the Final_Project_Presentation.pdf document.
